# TSDFSA: A Two-Stage Dynamic Feature Selection Method Based on Attention Mechanism for Multi-sensor Data

TSDFSA is a feature selection algorithm for neural networks based on the attention mechanism for multi-sensor data, which uses the attention mechanism.
## Experiments

To install the `Two_Stage_Dynamic` package, download the datasets, and test the experiments, run `sh run.sh`.

To run the full experimental suite for Sequential Attention, run `python -m Two_Stage_Dynamic.experiments.experiments` after running `sh run.sh` and `source Two_Stage_Dynamic/bin/activate`.
